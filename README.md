# weatherTrial

Trial for a weather app with simplistic UI and the bare minimum information that I need. Right now the location services is accessed, but
not used in the fetching of the weather data which is hard coded right now (Paris, France). 

## To be added
- autoupdate location
- call openweather api using the users location
- dynamically changing background illustration
